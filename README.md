<h1>OOP Principles in Unity â€“ A Practical Guide with C# ðŸŽ®</h1>
Overview
This project is built in Unity and demonstrates Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles using C# scripts. Each OOP concept (Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance, and Polymorphism) is explained through practical examples in the Unity Editor, helping developers understand how to apply OOP in real-world Unity game development.

OOP Concepts Covered
1. Encapsulation ðŸ”’
Definition: Encapsulation restricts direct access to data and ensures that it is modified through well-defined methods.

Example in Unity:

The Player class has private health variables with public methods to update them.

Prevents direct modifications and ensures controlled access.

csharp
Copy
Edit
public class Player : MonoBehaviour
{
    private int health = 100;

    public void TakeDamage(int damage)
    {
        health -= damage;
        Debug.Log("Player Health: " + health);
    }
}
2. Abstraction ðŸŽ­
Definition: Abstraction hides complex details and provides a simple interface for interacting with objects.

Example in Unity:

The Weapon class defines an abstract method Attack(), which is implemented differently in Gun and Sword subclasses.

csharp
Copy
Edit
public abstract class Weapon : MonoBehaviour
{
    public abstract void Attack();
}

public class Gun : Weapon
{
    public override void Attack()
    {
        Debug.Log("Shooting with gun!");
    }
}

public class Sword : Weapon
{
    public override void Attack()
    {
        Debug.Log("Swinging sword!");
    }
}
3. Inheritance ðŸ§¬
Definition: Inheritance allows a class to derive properties and behaviors from another class.

Example in Unity:

Enemy is a base class, and Zombie and Robot inherit from it, reusing common properties like health and movement.

csharp
Copy
Edit
public class Enemy : MonoBehaviour
{
    public int health = 100;

    public void TakeDamage(int damage)
    {
        health -= damage;
        Debug.Log("Enemy Health: " + health);
    }
}

public class Zombie : Enemy
{
    void Start()
    {
        Debug.Log("Zombie spawned with " + health + " health.");
    }
}

public class Robot : Enemy
{
    void Start()
    {
        Debug.Log("Robot activated with " + health + " health.");
    }
}
4. Polymorphism ðŸŽ­ðŸ”„
Definition: Polymorphism allows methods to be overridden or used interchangeably through a common interface.

Example in Unity:

The Enemy class has a virtual method Attack(), which is overridden by Zombie and Robot classes.

csharp
Copy
Edit
public class Enemy : MonoBehaviour
{
    public virtual void Attack()
    {
        Debug.Log("Enemy attacks!");
    }
}

public class Zombie : Enemy
{
    public override void Attack()
    {
        Debug.Log("Zombie bites!");
    }
}

public class Robot : Enemy
{
    public override void Attack()
    {
        Debug.Log("Robot fires laser!");
    }
}
